""""3. Quarter of the Year
Write a program that asks the user for a month as a number between 1 and 12. The
program should display a message indicating whether the month is in the first quarter,
the second quarter, the third quarter, or the fourth quarter of the year. Following are the
guidelines:
• If the user enters either 1, 2, or 3, the month is in the first quarter.
• If the user enters a number between 4 and 6, the month is in the second quarter.
• If the number is either 7, 8, or 9, the month is in the third quarter.
• If the month is between 10 and 12, the month is in the fourth quarter.
• If the number is not between 1 and 12, the program should display an error.
