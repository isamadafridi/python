"""The date June 10, 1960, is special because when it is written in the following format, the
month times the day equals the year:
6/10/60
Design a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day, and a twodigit
year. The program should then determine whether the month times the day equals the
year. If so, it should display a message saying the date is magic. Otherwise, it should display
a message saying the date is not magic.

Ask from user to enter a month
Ask from user to enter a day
Ask from user to enter a two-digit year
